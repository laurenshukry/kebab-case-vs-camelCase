        <h1>Welcome to the camelCase vs kebab-case Reading Experiment!</h1>
        
        <p>This experiment aims to investigate how the format of identifiers affects reading speed and accuracy.
            Identifiers are names given to elements in code, like variables or functions, and are often composed of multiple words.</p>
        
      

       
        <p>Studies show that using explicit separators (like spaces or symbols) can make reading easier in natural language.
            We want to test if this is true for programming identifiers as well. By participating, you’ll help us determine
            if one format is read more quickly or accurately than the other.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Task ?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You will be shown a sentence, such as “move south.”</li>
            <li>Afterward, you will see a list of identifiers written in different forms.</li>
            <li>Your goal is to select the identifier that matches the sentence you were shown.</li>
            <li>Some identifiers will be similar to the sentence but slightly different, so please choose carefully.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Aim for both accuracy and speed; your time will be measured for each selection.</li>
            <li>We recommend focusing on recognizing word boundaries and matching the phrase as accurately as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        
       
        
        <p> Is readingthistext more difficult than reading_this_text or reading this text ? Help us find out !
            Click “Start Experiment” when you are ready to begin. Thank you for participating!</p>
